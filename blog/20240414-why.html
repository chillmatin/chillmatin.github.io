            <p>The question of why has long been a center of attention for philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and
                basically everyone else living on this planet. Some have even tried to prohibit people from asking the
                question… but why? The ability to ask why is one of the most powerful tools that has enabled humans to
                dominate all living species on the globe. Given the deterministic — cause and effect — nature of the
                world we live in, knowing why means guessing the long chain of cause and effect. This, in itself, gives
                us the ability to predict the future. From this perspective, asking why is merely asking for the cause,
                and knowing the cause is not enough to fulfill humans' search for meaning. Or is it?</p>

                Before discussing anything, defining terms is the most important step. This ensures all parties are
                thinking about the same thing when a certain word is used. Let’s start with the word “Meaning”. What
                does it even “mean”? Meaning is inherently a human phenomenon. When a person consistently “understands”
                something in the same way each time they are presented with the same or similar information, that
                information actually “means” something to the person. So what is the meaning of human life? The answer
                is “exactly what a human understands about life”.

            <p>The question "Why?" sounds so simple yet it has many deep layers to it. Richard Feynman beautifully
                articulates this phenomenon.

            <p>What he basically says is that asking why requires one to know the framework by which the answer is
                expected. Being well-acquainted with our frameworks might be the step towards asking the best why
                questions. This leads us to self-criticism. Criticizing ourselves based on asking proper why questions
                is essential. So, when asking the question, we assume the answer to these two questions: What do I know?
                What do I want to know? It is sort of like going from point A to point B in our mental world. Let’s
                examine a sample question: Why is the sky blue? <label
                for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span
                class="sidenote">Here is the <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/">answer</a> by NASA</span> There could be many layers of answers to this question,
                but normally we can simplify it into these two questions. What do I know? Well, you might say, I am just
                a high school student with basic knowledge of physics, optics, colors, etc. You might also say that you
                know what the sky is and the fact that the sky is blue. You just lack the logical path and connections
                between these two mental points: physics knowledge and basic facts such as the blueness of the sky.</p>

            <p>After knowing the answers to these two questions, we understand the framework of the "why." Returning to
                the <i>meaning</i> argument, knowing the listener's framework is crucial for conveying the intended
                meaning. What if the listener's assumed knowledge is wrong or insufficient? Well, the listener will not
                be able to mentally connect the points. Our thought processes are optimized for these situations too.
                When we encounter information contradictory to our mental map of knowledge, we start to question our
                assumed knowledge. Correcting these erroneous or incomplete assumptions helps us understand things
                better and quicker, as it refines our knowledge maps. This approach really resembles the way Deep Neural
                Networks improve themselves through backpropagation algorithms. <label

            <p>Have you ever experienced a sense of enlightenment when engaging deeply in conversation about profound
                topics with a friend? Well, perhaps you've experienced it with yourself too. When we articulate our
                thoughts — whether on a website, paper, or someone's ears — our brains are reprocessing that
                information. This ensures our ideas about the concepts are well understood. When we understand new
                things, they challenge our previous beliefs. That's why I love understanding new concepts, at least the
                essence of them. In short, the purpose of this blog is to express my thoughts and understand them better
                together with the readers. Understanding something starts with a single question: Why?</p>
