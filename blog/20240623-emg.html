            <p>During the spring term of 2023-2024, senior computer engineering students at IZTECH take the mandatory embedded systems course, <a href="https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/tr/courses/ceng-424/">CENG424</a>, instructed by <a href="https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/people/berat-alper-erol/">Berat A. Erol</a>. As part of this course, we were required to form teams of 3-4 members to create a project and present it at the end of the term.</p>

            <h2>Team Formation and Project Selection</h2>           
            <p>I teamed up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/berkan-g%C3%B6n%C3%BClsever-2b71b62a2/">Berkan Gönülsever</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fhricetin/">Fahrettin Çetin</a>. Our first task, back in February, was to decide on a project. Given my interest in neuroscience, I proposed a project inspired by this <a href="https://youtu.be/rSQNi5sAwuc?si=h2_EGm5VbpcOZoFU" target="_blank">Brain Computer Interaction Project video</a>. My teammates were very supportive of this idea.</p>

            <h2>Planning and Execution</h2>
            <p>We began the project with high motivation, meticulously planning and keeping detailed notes. After evaluating the requirements, we ordered the necessary components from Amazon. Unfortunately, this was a mistake, as we waited for a month and the order never arrived. We then ordered the same product from another website, waited another week or two, and finally received it. This delay left us with limited time to build the actual project.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
            <p>During the project, one of the critical components got fried, necessitating a re-order. In our desperation, we visited Çankaya, İzmir, and discovered that the products we had waited months for were available locally the whole time. This experience taught us a valuable lesson about sourcing materials locally first.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
            <p>When working on time-sensitive projects, first explore local shops. Ordering online carries a higher risk of delaying the project than checking nearby stores.</p>

            <h2>Project Implementation</h2>
            <p>Despite the setbacks, implementing the project was straightforward, and we had a lot of fun throughout the process. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/chillmatin/Telepathy" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for our project, and here is the project <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chillmatin/Telepathy/5bde102be4a07a2ad727c638407b68d9d84110a9/TermProjectReport.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
