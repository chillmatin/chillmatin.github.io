            <p>I am Matin Huseynzade, a computer engineering student aspiring to specialize in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Over the course of 7 years, I have developed expertise in diverse areas of computer science, including web development, cybersecurity, heterogeneous parallel computation systems, machine learning, and open-source software. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in volunteer work, such as translating for <a href="https://az.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy Azerbaijani</a>, participating in university communities, and serving as chairperson in  <a href="https://ieee.iyte.edu.tr/komiteler/computer-society/">the IZTECH IEEE Computer Society</a> for a school year. Currently, I hold positions as both a board member and a project manager at the  <a href="https://neuroscience.az/">Azerbaijani Neuroscience Society</a>.</p>
